    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cake is a sweet, baked dessert made from flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and a leavening agent like baking powder or 
        baking soda. It comes in various textures and flavors, from light and fluffy sponge cakes to rich and dense chocolate 
        cakes. Cakes can be layered with fillings like cream, jam, or ganache and are often frosted with buttercream, fondant, 
        or whipped cream. They are commonly enjoyed on special occasions like birthdays and weddings but can also be a simple 
        treat. Popular varieties include chocolate cake, vanilla cake, red velvet, and fruit cake.</p>
